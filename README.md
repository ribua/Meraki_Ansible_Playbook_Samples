This repo is a place for me to store sample playbooks I've written, hopefully these can be found useful by other Meraki admins for the purpose of reverse engineering, idea generation and education.

Note: I run these as quick Dev experiments to see how they operate and work, therefore they should be viewed more as individual tasks and plays than inplace production playbooks.

For example, I export my API key in terminal before I run the plays rather than storing it in credential file, as per the documentation in the Meraki repo https://github.com/meraki/dashboard-api-ansible?tab=readme-ov-file#use
