This repo is a place for me to store sample playbooks I've written, hopefully these can be found useful by other Meraki admins for the purpose of reverse engineering, idea generation and education.

Note as I run these as quick Dev experiences to see how they operation and look I export my API key in terminal before I run the plays as per the documentation in the Meraki repo https://github.com/meraki/dashboard-api-ansible?tab=readme-ov-file#use
